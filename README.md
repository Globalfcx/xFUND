# xTokenize
xTokenize is a platform for tokenizing the value of the community. By combining NFTs on the XRPL, we will be able to add value to the community that we have built on the XRPL network.

The xTokenize Platform will also serve as the XRPL Projects Hub, where the most important information about all XRPL projects is aggregated, validated, and summarized.

What is the main goal of the xTokenize Global Platform?

To unlock the value of the community and allow it to be tokenized on the XRPL.

xTokenize - Summary & Key Points

• Unlocking community value by tokenization

• Aggregating key information about projects built on the XRPL

• A tool for XRPL Projects to build their global communities using a dedicated "page builder" and by having access to the worldwide ambassadors database.

• Global community Hub and database about XRPL projects. Newcomers will gain knowledge about XRPL and projects built there in an easy way.

• Custom settings will be loaded for each personal account.

• The content for each project will be displayed as a "one-pager."

• xTokenize Blackboard feature, where people from around the world can join various XRPL Projects to help build the global community and serve as ambassadors/supporters to build up local communities around the specific XRPL project.

What problems will xTokenize solve?

The Focus FCX project has been in existence for over a year. During this time, we discovered that communication is a real barrier and problematic entry threshold for thousands of people. English is a widely known language worldwide, but many people do not properly understand it. Especially in the Asia or Africa region, and even in Europe, people have some difficulties understanding messages in English. We were able to expand the east side of the world because we gained a few excellent ambassadors who were able to communicate information about Focus FCX in their native language. We know that there is huge potential locked in the community, and thanks to the xTokenize Platform, it can be unlocked."
